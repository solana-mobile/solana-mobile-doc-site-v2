Web apps can be published on the dApp Store by wrapping them as a Progressive Web App (PWA) inside an Android APK.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a PWA">
Add a [web manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) to your web app to make it a Progressive Web App.
</Step>
<Step title="Wrap into an Android APK">
Use a tool like Bubblewrap CLI to wrap your PWA in a [Trusted Web Activity (TWA)](/dapp-store/build-and-sign-an-apk) and produce a signed Android APK.
</Step>
<Step title="Publish to the dApp Store">
Submit your signed APK through the standard dApp Store publishing process.
</Step>
</Steps>
