### Prerequisites

- Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for development and device management.

- Follow the [prerequisite setup](/developers/development-setup#prerequisite-setup) guide to set up your [Android Device/Emulator](/developers/development-setup#2-setup-deviceemulator) and install a MWA-compatible wallet, like [fakewallet](/developers/development-setup#3-install-a-wallet-app).

## Solana Mobile Kotlin Compose Scaffold

The quickest way to start developing on Kotlin is to build off of the [Solana Jetpack Compose Scaffold](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-kotlin-compose-scaffold) example.

The scaffold is a basic Solana Android app built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and Material 3 components.

Follow the quickstart guide to install and run the scaffold app.

## Android Project Setup

### Setting up a fresh Android Project

Follow these steps to setup a fresh Android project with the recommended libraries for Solana development.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your Android project's build.gradle file">

In Android Studio, navigate to your Android project's module `build.gradle.kts` file.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Solana dependencies">

Include the following dependencies to your Android project's `build.gradle.kts` file. These are the recommended core Kotlin libraries for Solana transaction building, RPC requests, and wallet signing.

<CodeGroup>
```js build.gradle.kts
{
`dependencies {
    implementation("com.solanamobile:mobile-wallet-adapter-clientlib-ktx:${versions.KOTLIN_MWA_CLIENTLIB_KTX_VERSION}")
    implementation("com.solanamobile:web3-solana:${versions.KOTLIN_WEB3_SOLANA_VERSION}")
    implementation("com.solanamobile:rpc-core:${versions.KOTLIN_RPC_CORE_VERSION}")
    implementation("io.github.funkatronics:multimult:${versions.KOTLIN_MULTIMULT_VERSION}")
}`
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Overview of each dependency:">

- `com.solanamobile:mobile-wallet-adapter-clientlib-ktx`: Mobile Wallet Adapter client library for interacting with MWA-compatible wallets.
- `com.solanamobile:web3-solana`: Solana Kotlin library providing core Solana primitives like transaction building and public key class.
- `com.solanamobile:rpc-core`: A Kotlin library providing a generic interface and abstractions for building Solana RPC requests.
- `io.github.funkatronics:multimult`: Lightweight utility library for Base58 conversions.

</Accordion>
</Step>
<Step title="Build and run your app">

Your project's dependencies should be set up and you can try building and run the app!
</Step>
</Steps>
## Next Steps

Congrats! At this point, you have installed the necessary libraries for your project and are ready to start building an app that interacts with the Solana network.
