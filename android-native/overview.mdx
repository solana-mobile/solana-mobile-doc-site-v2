## Benefits of native Android development

### Direct access to Android OS features

Developing on Android enables convenient and full access to the Android platform's capabilities. Developers can access OS-specific functionalities like Camera SDK, ARKit, Touch ID, hardware sensors, etc without needing any bridging.

### Optimized performance

Native Android apps, as a result of full utilization of the system capabilities, generally have better performance and efficiency. Native apps provide the highest attainable frame rates, computing power, graphics support, etc.

### Jetpack Compose

Kotlin enables the building of Android apps using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/why-adopt), a modern toolkit for creating native Android UIs. The Kotlin sample apps on this documentation site are all built with Jetpack Compose.
