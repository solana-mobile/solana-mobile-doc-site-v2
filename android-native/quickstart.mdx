## Solana Jetpack Compose Scaffold

The scaffold app serves as both a starting implementation and an example reference of how to use the core Kotlin SDKs, like `web3-core`, `rpc-core`, and Mobile Wallet Adapter.

It includes:

- Core Solana kotlin libraries
- Pre-built Compose UI components
- Code examples of transaction building and RPC requests

## Prerequisites

Follow the [prerequisite setup](/developers/development-setup#prerequisite-setup) guide to set up Android Studio, your [Android Device/Emulator](/developers/development-setup#2-setup-deviceemulator) and install a MWA-compatible wallet, like [fakewallet](/developers/development-setup#3-install-a-wallet-app).

## Install the Jetpack Compose Scaffold

**Clone the repo**

The scaffold app is open source and can be fetched from [Github](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-kotlin-compose-scaffold).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-kotlin-compose-scaffold.git
```

**Open the project in Android Studio**

In Android Studio, open the project with `File > Open > SolanaKotlinComposeScaffold/build.gradle.kts`

**Build and run**

Ensure you have connected an Android emulator or device and it is detected by Android Studio. If not, follow this [guide](/developers/development-setup#2-setup-deviceemulator) to setup your emulator/device.

In the top bar of Android Studio, select `"app"` as the configuration and your emulator/device, then click run.

If successful, the scaffold app will launch on your emulator/device.

Connect with a locally installed wallet app to start interacting with the Solana network! 🎉
