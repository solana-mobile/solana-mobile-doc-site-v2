We recommend beginning with a Solana Mobile template app generated by `create-solana-dapp`. The pre-built templates provide:

- React Native framework (powered by Expo)
- Mobile Wallet Adapter and Solana RPC integration examples
- Pre-built components, navigation, and React hooks

## Initialize your project

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create solana-dapp@latest
```

When prompted, select the **Solana Mobile** framework, then choose from the available template options.

## Build and run your app

Install dependencies, then build and launch the app on your connected Android device or emulator.
