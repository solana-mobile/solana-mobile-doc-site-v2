<Accordion title="What does it mean for the dApp Store to be 'fee-free'?">
Solana Mobile Inc. does not currently collect any fees on in-app purchases, app purchases, or subscriptions, nor are any fees collected on its behalf by apps in the catalog.

Developers are free to implement their own metric collection and logging within their apps. For example, [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/get-started?platform=android) is a popular measurement solution that provides mobile SDKs.

Your submission is now in the app review process and publishers typically receive an update in 2-3 business days.

In the meantime, get in contact with the app review team by joining the Solana Mobile Discord, getting the *developer* role, and leaving a message in the `#dapp-store` channel.
