## Why React Native?

[**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) is a popular development framework for creating mobile apps using React and Javascript. This section goes over the benefits of React Native and why you might choose it to build your mobile app.

### Code Reusability

Solana developers can continue using popular, well-supported Solana web libraries like `@solana/web3.js` and leverage their existing code in a React Native project. Developers familiar with Solana Web development will find this their quickest option to start building.

### Familiarity

Developers familiar with React development will be able to leverage their existing knowledge and translate it to building mobile apps. Just like React development on web, React Native supports live and hot reloading, which significantly speeds up the development process.

## Expo?

[**Expo**](https://docs.expo.dev/) is a popular platform that simplifies the development and deployment process for React Native projects, with the tradeoff of stricter customization of native code.

To use Expo with the MWA libraries, you'll need to follow an alternate Expo development flow, called a [custom Expo Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).
