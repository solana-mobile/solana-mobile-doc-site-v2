## About the Program

The Solana Mobile Builder Grants Program is a program dedicated to providing opportunities to Solana developers that are motivated to push the Solana Mobile Developer Ecosystem forward.

This program will offer a few variety of grant types, each with their own specific goals and functions.

## Colosseum Cypherpunk Hackathon Grants

We're excited to announce the Solana Mobile Builder Grants Program running alongside the Colosseum Cypherpunk Hackathon. We're sweetening the prize pool for teams that bring mobile into focus.

**Up to 10 teams will receive $10K builder grants for mobile-focused dApps.**

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll be evaluating submissions closely. It should be obvious in your submissions that you've integrated or optimized for mobile — and that you intend to go mobile.

**If you're building mobile-first, make sure to check the mobile box on your submission ☑️**

## What Selected Teams Receive

Selected teams will receive:

- • **$10k builder grant**
- • **Marketing support**

We'll work closely with you on your journey to launching on the Solana dApp Store.

*Note: Grants are awarded after your dApp is submitted.*
