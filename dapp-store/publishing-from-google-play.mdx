## Overview

Publishing your existing Google Play app to the dApp Store requires:
1. A release APK file signed with a **new, unique signing key** (different from Google Play)
2. Following the standard dApp Store publishing workflow

Key differences from Google Play:
- **File Format**: dApp Store submission requires APK files (Google Play uses AAB)
- **Signing Key**: Must use a completely separate signing key from Google Play
- **In-App Purchases**: No 30% tax on in-app purchases or transactions

<Warning>
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: 

You cannot use the same signing key for both Google Play and the dApp Store.
</Warning>

## Build Your APK

### 1. Create New Signing Key

Generate a new signing key exclusively for the dApp Store:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore dappstore.keystore \
  -alias dappstore \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000
```

**Store the keystore file and passwords securely** - losing them means you cannot update your app.

For reference, view the [Android app signing guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).

### 3. Verify APK
Confirm your APK is properly signed before submission:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs app-release.apk
```

For reference, view the [apksigner documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner#usage-verify).
