## Discord

The [Solana Mobile Discord](https://discord.gg/solanamobile) is the primary entrypoint for getting support regarding the dApp Store.

For questions about publishing and app review, grab a **Developer** role in the `#developer` channel, then use the ticketing system in `#dev-answers` to get a private chat with Solana Mobile staff.

## App Review

If you've successfully submitted an app, you will receive an app review result sent to your developer email from **publishersupport@dappstore.solanamobile.com** within 3-5 business days.

We review apps in order as they are submitted, so please be patient as we go through the review queue.

If it has been more than 5 business days since a response, submit an **App Review Inquiry** in the `#dev-answers` channel.
