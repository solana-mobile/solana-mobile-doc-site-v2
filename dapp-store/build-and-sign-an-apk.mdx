---

The Solana dApp Store accepts **signed APK** files. This guide covers how to build and sign an APK for your project, regardless of framework.

## Create a signing key

Every app needs its own signing key. For a full understanding of how Android app signing works, see the [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#certificates-keystores).

Generate a keystore for your app:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-app-name.keystore \
  -alias my-app-name \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000
```

Replace `my-app-name` with your app's name.

Store the keystore file and passwords securely — losing them means you cannot update your app. All future updates must be signed with the same key.

<Warning>
If your app is also published on Google Play, you **must** use a separate signing key for the dApp Store. You cannot reuse the same key for both stores.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Publishing multiple apps?">
Each app should have its own signing key. You can keep things organized by storing multiple key aliases in a single keystore file:

```bash
# First app
keytool -genkey -v -keystore publisher.keystore -alias my-first-app -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Second app
keytool -genkey -v -keystore publisher.keystore -alias my-second-app -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Then reference the appropriate `-alias` when signing each app.
</Accordion>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Expo" icon="react">

By default, EAS builds an Android App Bundle (.aab). The dApp Store requires an APK instead.

For signing, EAS can automatically generate and manage a keystore for you on your first build. Alternatively, you can provide your own keystore created with the [instructions above](#create-a-signing-key).

## 1. Configure EAS for APK builds

Add a `dapp-store` build profile to your `eas.json`:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "dapp-store": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Build the APK

<Tabs>
<Tab title="EAS Cloud">

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile dapp-store
```

The build runs on EAS servers. Once finished, download the APK from the link provided.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Local Build">

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile dapp-store --local
```

The build runs on your machine. Requires the [Android SDK and NDK](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local) installed locally. The APK is output to the project directory.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

On your first build, EAS will prompt you to either generate a new keystore automatically or provide an existing one.

## Verify the APK

Confirm your APK is properly signed:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs app-release.apk
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Native Android" icon="android">

## 1. Configure signing in build.gradle

Add a signing config in your `app/build.gradle`:

```kotlin app/build.gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        dappStore {
            storeFile file("keystores/my-app-name.keystore")
            storePassword "your_keystore_password"
            keyAlias "my-app-name"
            keyPassword "your_key_password"
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.dappStore
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Build the APK

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Or in Android Studio: **Build** > **Build APK(s)**.

Your signed APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.

## 3. Verify the APK

Confirm your APK is properly signed:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs app-release.apk
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="PWA" icon="globe">

[Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) can be published on the dApp Store by wrapping them in a [Trusted Web Activity (TWA)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity). TWAs use Chrome to render your web app in a full-screen, native-like experience.

### Prerequisite

A PWA [web manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) hosted at `https://your-pwa-url.com/manifest.json`.

<Accordion title="Template: Web Manifest">
At minimum, a manifest file includes the app's name, icons, and start URL:

```json manifest.json
{
    "name": "APP_NAME",
    "short_name": "APP_NAME",
    "scope": "/",
    "start_url": "/",
    "icons": [
        {
            "src": "/android-chrome-192x192.png",
            "sizes": "192x192",
            "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
            "src": "/android-chrome-512x512.png",
            "sizes": "512x512",
            "type": "image/png"
        }
    ],
    "theme_color": "#ffffff",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "display": "standalone"
}
```

For more information, view the [web manifest documentation](https://web.dev/articles/add-manifest).
</Accordion>

## 1. Install Bubblewrap CLI

[Bubblewrap CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap/tree/main/packages/cli) converts your PWA into an Android app using TWA.

```bash
npm i -g @bubblewrap/cli
```

## 2. Initialize the project

In a new directory, run `init` with the URL to your web manifest:

```bash
bubblewrap init --manifest https://your-pwa-url.com/manifest.json
```

This will prompt you to configure the domain, display mode, splash screen, icons, and signing keystore.

- If it asks to install additional tooling (e.g. Android SDK, JDK), allow it.

<Warning>
The `init` command will generate an **Android Keystore**. Keep the keystore file and password secure — losing them means you cannot update your app.
</Warning>

## 3. Add supported languages

Before building, specify the languages your app supports. By default, Bubblewrap incorrectly declares support for all locales.

In the generated Android project, edit `build.gradle`:

```java build.gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        resConfigs "en" // Add any locales your app supports
    }
}
```

## 4. Build the APK

```bash
bubblewrap build
```

This outputs a signed release APK.

## 5. Publish Digital Asset Links

[Digital Asset Links (DAL)](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started) establish a connection between your website and the Android app. Without this, the app will show Chrome browser UI instead of a full-screen experience.

<Steps>
<Step>
Generate the SHA256 fingerprint from your keystore:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore android.keystore
```
</Step>
<Step>
Add the fingerprint to your TWA manifest:

```bash
bubblewrap fingerprint add <SHA256_fingerprint>
```
</Step>
<Step>
Generate the `assetlinks.json` file:

```bash
bubblewrap fingerprint generateAssetLinks
```
</Step>
<Step>
Publish the generated `assetlinks.json` at:

`https://your-domain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Test the APK

Install and test on a device or emulator:

```bash
bubblewrap install app-release-signed.apk
```

<Tip>
If you see the browser navigation bar at the top of the app, your Digital Asset Links may not be configured correctly. Double-check step 5.
</Tip>

### Updating your TWA

To release a new version, edit `twa-manifest.json` and run:

```bash
bubblewrap update --manifest=./path/to/twa-manifest.json
bubblewrap build
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next steps

With your signed APK ready, follow the dApp Store publishing process:
