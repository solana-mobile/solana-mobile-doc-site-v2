## 1. Navigate to the Publisher Portal

Log into the [Solana dApp Publisher Portal](https://publish.solanamobile.com) and find your published app in the sidebar.

## 2. Update your app details

If needed, you can make changes to your app details (e.g Name, Descriptions, Preview Assets, etc) in the "Details" page.

<Note>
**NOTE:** 

**These changes will only reflect in the dApp Store after a new release version is approved**

## 3. Submit an updated release version

Navigate to your app's "Home" screen and press the "New Version" button.

### Submit an existing APK

If you only want to make a change to your app details and do not want to submit a new APK build, then select
the **"use existing APK"** option.

### Submit an updated APK

If you want to submit a new APK, ensure:
- The APK is signed with the same Android signing key you used for your initial release.
- The `versionName` and `versionCode` value is properly incremented between each update.
- The "What's new" section is filled out. This section will be displayed to users in your dApp Store listing page.

After you've completed the upload, press "Submit" and you'll be prompted to sign messages and transactions for uploading to Arweave and minting your Release NFT.
