A Release NFT:

- Contains metadata that represents a specific release version of an app.
- Should be newly created each time an updated app version is submitted.

## Mint a release NFT

Using the same wallet that contains your App NFT, run this command.

```shell
npx dapp-store create release -k <path_to_your_keypair> -b <path_to_your_android_sdk_build_tools> [-u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url>]
```

**You will repeat this step for each new version of your dApp you want to release**. The mint address of the latest release is recorded in your configuration file.

<Tip>
**TIP**

When using CLI version >= `0.8.0`, the following commands will submit a Solana transaction that includes a default priority fee of `500000` lamports.

To customize this value, use param `-p` or `--priority-fee-lamports <priority-fee-lamports>`
</Tip>

<Warning>
**CAUTION**

Please make sure your network connection is reliable and has a minimum upload speed of 0.25 megabytes per second.
</Warning>

## Submit your app

After minting a complete set of on-chain NFTs (App NFT and Release NFT), you may choose to submit them to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal, as a candidate for inclusion in the Solana dApp Store catalog:

```shell
npx dapp-store publish submit -k <path_to_your_keypair> -u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url> --requestor-is-authorized --complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies
```

The two flags for this command (`--requestor-is-authorized` and `--complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies`) are attestations from the requestor that this dApp is compliant with Solana dApp Store policies, and that they are authorized to submit this request to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal.

By submitting this command  you agree to, and represent that you have read, (i) the [Solana Mobile dApp Store Developer Agreement](/dapp-store/agreement), including the arbitration clause linked [here](/dapp-store/agreement#:~:text=force%20and%20effect.-,16.6.%20Arbitration.,-The%20parties%20agree), meaning that, where enforceable, any dispute related to the dApp Store will be resolved through BINDING ARBITRATION on an individual, non-class basis, and (ii) the [Solana Mobile Publisher Policy](/dapp-store/publisher-policy).
