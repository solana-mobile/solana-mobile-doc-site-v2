Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA) is an open protocol that defines how mobile apps communicate with wallet apps on the same device. It provides a standardized way to request transaction signing, message signing, and wallet authorization — regardless of which wallet the user has installed.

## Why it matters

On desktop, apps connect to wallets through browser extensions. On mobile, there are no browser extensions. MWA solves this by providing a direct, local communication channel between apps and wallet apps:

- **Implement once, support all wallets** — Your app works with any MWA-compliant wallet (Phantom, Solflare, Seed Vault Wallet, etc.) without per-wallet integration code.
- **User choice** — Users pick the wallet they prefer. Your app doesn't need to know or care which one they use.
- **Simple integration** — The MWA SDK abstracts the protocol details. For most developers, integration is a few lines of code.

## How it works

- The client app initiates a session by sending an Android intent to the wallet app.
- A local WebSocket connection is established between the client and wallet.
- The client sends MWA requests (authorization, transaction signing, message signing) over the connection.
- The wallet surfaces an approval UI (e.g., a bottom sheet) for the user to review and approve.

See the [MWA protocol specification](https://solana-mobile.github.io/mobile-wallet-adapter/spec/spec.html) for more detail.

## Platform support

| Platform | Support |
|---|---|
| Android | Full support |
| Mobile web (Chrome for Android) | Supported |
| iOS | Not supported |

<Info>
  iOS does not support MWA due to platform restrictions on inter-app communication.
