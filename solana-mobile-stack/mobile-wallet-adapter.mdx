Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA) is an open protocol that defines how mobile dApps communicate with wallet apps on the same device. It provides a standardized way to request transaction signing, message signing, and wallet authorization — regardless of which wallet the user has installed.

## Why it matters

On desktop, dApps connect to wallets through browser extensions. On mobile, there are no browser extensions. MWA solves this by providing a direct, local communication channel between dApps and wallet apps:

- **Implement once, support all wallets** — Your dApp works with any MWA-compliant wallet (Phantom, Solflare, Seed Vault Wallet, etc.) without per-wallet integration code.
- **User choice** — Users pick the wallet they prefer. Your app doesn't need to know or care which one they use.
- **Simple integration** — The MWA SDK abstracts the protocol details. For most developers, integration is a few lines of code.

## How it works

When your dApp needs the user to sign a transaction, MWA handles the flow:

1. **Your dApp sends a request** — The MWA SDK dispatches an Android intent to the user's wallet app.
2. **The wallet app opens** — A wallet UI (typically a bottom sheet) appears, showing the transaction details for user review.
3. **The user approves** — The wallet signs the transaction using the user's private key and returns the signed transaction to your dApp.
4. **Your dApp submits** — The signed transaction is submitted to the Solana network.

The entire session runs over a local connection on the device. No data is sent to external servers during the signing process.

## Platform support

| Platform | Support |
|---|---|
| Android | Full support |
| Mobile web (Chrome for Android) | Supported |
| iOS | Not supported |

<Info>
  iOS does not support MWA due to platform restrictions on inter-app communication. See the [wallet-adapter-react](/get-started/web/apps) package for web-based alternatives that work across platforms.
