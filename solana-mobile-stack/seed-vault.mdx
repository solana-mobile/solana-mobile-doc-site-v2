Seed Vault is a secure key management system integrated into every Seeker device. It leverages the device's secure execution environment — isolated hardware that operates independently from the main operating system — to ensure that your private keys, seed phrases, and secrets never leave the protected hardware boundary.

## How it works

Seed Vault takes advantage of the secure processor built into Seeker's hardware. This secure environment is physically and logically separated from the Android operating system, which means:

- **Keys never leave the secure environment** — Signing operations happen inside the secure processor. The private key is never exposed to the Android OS, apps, or even the Seed Vault UI itself.
- **User authorization is required** — Every signing request requires explicit user approval through a trusted UI rendered by the secure environment.
- **Resistant to software attacks** — Even if the Android OS were compromised, an attacker cannot extract keys from the secure processor.

## Seed Vault Wallet

The Seed Vault Wallet is the built-in wallet app on Seeker that interfaces directly with the Seed Vault hardware. It serves as the default wallet for MWA transactions and is the wallet that holds the user's [Seeker Genesis Token](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker-id).

## For developers

Most developers interact with Seed Vault indirectly through the [Mobile Wallet Adapter](/solana-mobile-stack/mobile-wallet-adapter) protocol. When a user approves a transaction in their Seed Vault Wallet, MWA handles the communication between your dApp and the secure signing environment.

<Info>
  The Seed Vault SDK is designed for **wallet developers** building apps that interface directly with the secure hardware. If you're building a dApp, use the [MWA SDK](/get-started/mobile-wallet-adapter) instead.

## Seed Vault Simulator

For wallet developers, a Seed Vault Simulator is available for testing on standard Android devices (Android 12+). The simulator mimics the Seed Vault API surface but does **not** provide real hardware-backed security.

<Warning>
  The simulator is for development and testing only. It does not provide secure signing or key custody.
