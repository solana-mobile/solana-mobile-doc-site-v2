SKR is the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. It distributes control, powers curation, and aligns incentives across builders, users, and hardware partners.

Via SKR, the community governs, builders keep what they earn, and users own a stake in the value they create.

- **Mint address**: `SKRbvo6Gf7GondiT3BbTfuRDPqLWei4j2Qy2NPGZhW3`
- **Token type**: SPL Token

## Staking

SKR holders can stake their tokens to participate in the ecosystem. Stakers delegate their stake to a **Guardian**,
an onchain component of the Solana Mobile Stack.
