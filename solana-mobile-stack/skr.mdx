SKR is the domain name system for [Seeker](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker) users. Every Seeker owner receives a `.skr` address — a human-readable name that maps to their Solana wallet address, similar to how ENS domains work on Ethereum or `.sol` domains on Solana.

## What is a .skr address?

A `.skr` address replaces a long base58 wallet address with a simple, memorable name. Instead of sharing `7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU`, a user can share something like `alice.skr`.

This makes it easier to:

- **Send and receive tokens** — Use a `.skr` name instead of copying and pasting wallet addresses.
- **Identify users** — Display readable names in your app's UI instead of truncated addresses.
- **Build social features** — Reference users by their `.skr` identity across dApps.

## How it works

SKR is built on [AllDomains](https://alldomains.id/), a Solana naming service. The `.skr` top-level domain (TLD) is reserved for Seeker users and resolves bidirectionally:

- **Forward resolution** — Given a `.skr` name, look up the associated wallet address.
- **Reverse resolution** — Given a wallet address, look up the associated `.skr` name.

## For developers

You can integrate `.skr` address resolution into your app to display human-readable names and accept `.skr` addresses as input.
