Seeker is Solana Mobile's flagship Android device, designed from the ground up for crypto. It's the successor to the Saga and represents the next generation of crypto-native mobile hardware.

## What makes Seeker different

Unlike general-purpose smartphones, Seeker integrates Solana-specific technology at the hardware and OS level:

- **[Seed Vault](/solana-mobile-stack/seed-vault)** — A secure key custody system that keeps your private keys in a hardware-protected environment, separate from the rest of the operating system.
- **[dApp Store](/solana-mobile-stack/dapp-store)** — A pre-installed, open app marketplace where users can discover and install Solana dApps without the restrictions of traditional app stores.
- **[Seeker ID](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker-id)** — An onchain identity system that gives each Seeker owner a verifiable, device-linked identity on Solana.
- **[SKR domains](/solana-mobile-stack/skr)** — A native naming system that provides every Seeker user with a human-readable `.skr` address.

## Built for developers

Seeker runs Android and supports all standard Android development tools and frameworks. Any existing Android or React Native app can run on Seeker. The Solana-specific capabilities are additive — you can integrate them incrementally:

1. **Start with Mobile Wallet Adapter** — Add wallet connectivity to your app with a few lines of code using the [MWA SDK](/get-started/mobile-wallet-adapter).
2. **Detect Seeker users** — Use the [Seeker Genesis Token](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker-id) or platform APIs to identify Seeker owners and offer tailored experiences.
3. **Publish on the dApp Store** — [Submit your app](/dapp-store/submit-new-app) to reach Seeker's user base directly.
