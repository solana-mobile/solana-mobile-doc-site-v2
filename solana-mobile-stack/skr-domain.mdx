Every [Seeker](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker) owner receives a `.skr` domain — a human-readable name that maps to their Solana wallet address. Like the [Seeker Genesis Token](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker-genesis-token), a `.skr` domain is only minted once per device and can be transferred between a user's own wallet accounts within the [Seed Vault Wallet](/solana-mobile-stack/seed-vault).

Instead of sharing a long base58 wallet address, a user can share something like `alice.skr`. This makes it easier to send and receive tokens, display readable names in your app's UI, and reference users across apps.

## Resolution

SKR domains are built on [AllDomains](https://alldomains.id/) and support bidirectional resolution:

- **Forward resolution** — Given a `.skr` name, look up the associated wallet address.
- **Reverse resolution** — Given a wallet address, look up the associated `.skr` name.
