Seeker ID is the onchain identity for [Seeker](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker) owners. It consists of two components — a **Seeker Genesis Token** and a **.skr domain** — held in the user's [Seed Vault Wallet](/solana-mobile-stack/seed-vault).

## Seeker Genesis Token

The Seeker Genesis Token (SGT) is an NFT minted once per Seeker device when the owner first activates their Seed Vault Wallet. It serves as proof that a wallet belongs to a verified Seeker owner.

### Key properties

- **One per device** — Each Seeker device produces exactly one SGT, tied to the primary account in the Seed Vault Wallet.
- **Token-2022 standard** — The SGT uses Solana's Token Extensions program (Token-2022) with Metadata Pointer and Token Group Member extensions.
- **Limited transferability** — The SGT can only be transferred between a user's own wallet accounts within the Seed Vault Wallet. It cannot be freely traded or sent to other users.

### Why it matters for developers

The SGT enables a reliable way to identify Seeker users onchain. Common use cases include:

- **Exclusive features** — Gate access to features, content, or rewards for verified Seeker owners.
- **Anti-sybil** — Use the one-per-device property to prevent users from claiming rewards multiple times across multiple wallets.
- **Airdrops and distributions** — Target Seeker owners for token distributions or NFT drops.

### Verification

To verify a user holds an SGT, combine wallet ownership proof with an onchain token check:

1. **Prove wallet ownership** — Use [Sign In With Solana (SIWS)](https://github.com/phantom/sign-in-with-solana) to confirm the user controls the wallet.
2. **Check for SGT** — Query the wallet's token accounts to verify it holds a valid Seeker Genesis Token.
3. **Track mint addresses** — Record which SGT mint addresses have been used to prevent re-use after transfers.

## .skr domain

Every Seeker owner receives a `.skr` domain — a human-readable name that maps to their Solana wallet address, similar to how `.sol` domains work on Solana.

Instead of sharing a long base58 wallet address, a user can share something like `alice.skr`. This makes it easier to send and receive tokens, display readable names in your app's UI, and reference users across apps.

### Resolution

SKR domains are built on [AllDomains](https://alldomains.id/) and support bidirectional resolution:

- **Forward resolution** — Given a `.skr` name, look up the associated wallet address.
- **Reverse resolution** — Given a wallet address, look up the associated `.skr` name.

## Comparison with Saga Genesis Token

The Seeker Genesis Token builds on the concept introduced with the original Saga Genesis Token, but with key differences:

| | Seeker Genesis Token | Saga Genesis Token |
|---|---|---|
| **Token standard** | Token-2022 (Token Extensions) | Metaplex Token Standard |
| **Transferability** | Transferable within user's own Seed Vault accounts | Soulbound (non-transferable) |
| **Verification** | Token-2022 account queries | DAS API (Metaplex collection) |
