The Solana dApp Store is an alternative app distribution platform purpose-built for the Solana ecosystem. It comes pre-installed on every [Seeker](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker) device, giving developers a direct channel to reach crypto-native users.

## Why it exists

Traditional app stores impose restrictions that create friction for crypto apps — payment rails are tightly controlled, token-gated features face policy ambiguity, and NFT-related functionality risks removal. The dApp Store removes these barriers:

- **No revenue share** — Developers keep 100% of their revenue. There are no commissions on in-app transactions, token sales, or NFT minting.
- **Direct relationships** — Developers connect with their users directly, without an intermediary controlling the distribution or discovery of their app.
- **Crypto-friendly policies** — The dApp Store's [publisher policy](/dapp-store/publisher-policy) is designed for the realities of crypto apps, not against them.

## What you can publish

The dApp Store supports both native Android apps and web apps:

- **Android APKs** — Any standard Android app, built with any framework (React Native, Kotlin, Flutter, Unity, etc.).
- **Web apps** — Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) can be wrapped as Android APKs and published alongside native apps.

## Onchain publishing

App listings on the dApp Store are represented as NFTs on Solana. When you publish an app, its metadata (name, description, icon, APK hash) is stored onchain, creating a transparent, verifiable record of every app and update.

This onchain publishing model is managed through the [Publishing CLI](/dapp-store/publishing-cli/overview) or the [web publishing portal](https://publish.solanamobile.com/).
