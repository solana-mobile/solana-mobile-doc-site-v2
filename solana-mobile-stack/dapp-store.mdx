The Solana dApp Store is an alternative crypto friendly app store for the Solana ecosystem. It comes pre-installed on every [Seeker](/solana-mobile-stack/seeker) device, giving developers a channel to reach crypto-native users.

## Why it exists

For crypto to thrive on mobile, it needs a home built for it. The dApp Store provides a crypto-friendly [publisher policy](/dapp-store/publisher-policy) and a dedicated platform for developers to reach Solana users.

## What you can publish

The dApp Store supports both native Android apps and web apps:

- **Android APKs** — Any standard Android app, built with any framework (React Native, Kotlin, Flutter, Unity, etc.).
- **Web apps** — Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) can be wrapped as Android APKs and published alongside native apps. See [this guide](/recipes/general/publishing-a-web-app).

## Publishing

App listings on the dApp Store are represented as NFTs on Solana. When you publish an app, its metadata (name, description, icon, APK hash) is stored onchain.

Developers can publish by signing up and [submitting through the web publishing portal](/dapp-store/submit-new-app).
