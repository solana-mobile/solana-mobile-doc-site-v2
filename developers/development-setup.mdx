- Set up your local environment for Android development.
- Configure a device or emulator for building apps for the dApp Store.
- Install an MWA-compliant wallet app for development purposes.

## Set up Android development environment

To build apps for the dApp Store, you need to setup your environment for Android development.

<Note>
**Supported Frameworks**

<Tabs>
<Tab title= "Expo / React Native">
  For both Expo or React Native Android development:

  - View the Expo [**setup documentation**](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android\&device=physical\&mode=development-build\&buildEnv=local) (Choose custom development build instead of Expo Go).
</Tab>
<Tab title= "Kotlin (Native)">
For Kotlin Android development:

  - Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).
</Tab>
<Tab title= "Flutter">
  For Flutter Android development:

  - View the official Flutter [**setup documentation**](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/mobile-android#configure-android-development).
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Note>

## Setup Device/Emulator

You can test your app during development on any Android device or emulator. A Solana Mobile device is **not** required for dApp Store development—testing on a standard Android device is typically sufficient.

For detailed device setup instructions, refer to Android's official documentation:

## Install a development wallet app

The [Mobile Wallet Adapter](/mobile-wallet-adapter/overview) (MWA) library allows your app to connect and interact with compatible wallet apps on your device.

Install an MWA-compatible wallet app to test your app's Mobile Wallet Adapter integration.

### Mock MWA Wallet

Solana Mobile provides a mock development wallet for you to test your app with and get a feel of what Seed Vault Wallet interactions on the Seeker will look like.

The mock wallet features:

- Mobile Wallet Adapter support
- Simulate connection or signing errors
- QR Code Scanning for MWA Remote Connections

It is intended for development purposes only, so it does not store a persistent keypair and the wallet is reset each time the app is exited.

<Accordion title="Installation:">
  <Steps>
    <Step>
      Clone the Mock MWA Wallet repo from the [github repository](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mock-mwa-wallet)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/solana-mobile/mock-mwa-wallet.git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In Android Studio, `Open project > Navigate to the directory > Select mock-mwa-wallet/android/build.gradle`
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After Android Studio finishes loading the project, select `fakewallet` in the build/run configuration dropdown in the top right
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/static/img/mock-mwa-wallet-install.png" alt="Mock MWA Wallet build"/>
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After it builds successfully, you should see the app on your connected Android device or emulator.
  </Step>
