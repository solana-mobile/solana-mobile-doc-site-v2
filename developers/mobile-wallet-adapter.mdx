title: "Mobile Wallet Adapter"
description: "[**Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA)**](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter) is a generic protocol specification that enables dApps to connect with mobile wallet apps for Solana transaction and message signing."
---


## Why is it important?

- Developers only need to implement MWA once to be compatible with [all MWA-compliant wallets](https://solanamobile.com/wallets)! It eliminates the need to integrate with each wallet individually.

- Developers can focus entirely on their dApp's core functionality, with wallet integration handled at no cost.

- Users have freedom to select and use the mobile wallet app of their choice.
