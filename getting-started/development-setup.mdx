## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Android Studio

Install Android Studio to build apps and manage your device/emulator, following the official [Android developer docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/install). If you're planning on developing with React Native, then follow the [React Native Android environment setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### 2. Setup Device/Emulator

To test and preview your app as you develop, you can build and deploy your app to an Android device or emulator in Android Studio.
Follow official Android developer documentation to [create an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) or deploy your app to a [hardware device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).

### 3. Install a wallet app

The [Mobile Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter) (MWA) library allows your dApp to connect and interface with Wallet Apps that implement the MWA protocol. For testing, you want to have an MWA-compatible wallet on the same device or emulator as your dApp.

#### 1. Download, build, and install fakewallet

The [fakewallet](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter/tree/main/android/fakewallet) app is a 'fake' Mobile Wallet Adapter compliant wallet. Install it on your Android emulator or device. It does not store persistent keypairs, and the wallet is "reset" each time the app is exited.

<Steps>
<Step>
Clone the Mobile Wallet Adapter repo, containing the fakewallet app from the [github repository](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter.git
```
</Step>
<Step>
In Android Studio, `Open project > Navigate to the cloned directory > Select mobile-wallet-adapter/android/build.gradle`
</Step>
<Step>
After Android Studio finishes loading the project, select `fakewallet` in the build/run configuration dropdown in the top right

</Step>
<Step>
After it builds successfully, you should see the app on your Android device or emulator.
</Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>

#### 2. Install real wallet apps

fakewallet was created for implementation reference and quick testing purposes. You should also test your dApp with popular MWA-compatible wallet apps like [Phantom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.phantom), [Solflare](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.solflare.mobile), and [Ultimate](https://ultimate.app/).

You can install these onto an emulator by using an emulator with Google Play Store support. From there, you can login to your Google account and search for Phantom or Solflare to install it onto the emulator.

## Choose a development framework

Although, the Solana Mobile Stack is primarily written in native Android, we also have support for popular mobile
development frameworks.
