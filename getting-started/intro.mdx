description: "Welcome to the **Solana Mobile Documentation** site!"
---

The documentation site serves as a comprehensive knowledge center for developers that want to build with the **Solana Mobile Stack (SMS)**.

Here, you can find an excellent collection of guides, tutorials, and references aimed at assisting developers as they build Web3 mobile dApps.
In addition, there are also resources for developers wanting to publish on the [Solana dApp Store](/dapp-store/intro).

These resources are actively maintained by the [Solana Mobile](https://github.com/solana-mobile) team, but welcomes [contributions from the community](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-mobile-doc-site)!

<Note>
**Note:**

You don't need a Solana Mobile device or physical device to start developing. The stack is compatible with any Android device. See [**prerequisite setup**](#development-setup) to set up your development environment and start building!
